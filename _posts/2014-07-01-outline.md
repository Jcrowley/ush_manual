This outline is a preliminary sketch of what the Manual and Toolkit might look like. 

# Introduction
In Swahili, ushahidi means "testimony." During the 2008 Kenyan elections, violence rocked the nation as tribes and parties sparred over 

Enabling citizens to tell their stories, to give testimony t


The manual would begin with a story: a demonstration of how Ushahidi has been used successfully, but also a story that illustrates the challenge of telling a story with the data. The new capabilities in v3 to tell a story--to give testimony--will form the core the explanation of the manual and toolkit. The manual will begin with the challenges of giving testimony with v2 of the software. We will focus on the new interface and the emphasis on simplicity that the Ushahidi team has adopted in both the code and the UX.

## What is Ushahidi?
Ushahidi as testimony during 2008 Kenyan elections. Grew team to support the platform. Built new platforms. Today, Ushahidi might best be described as an organization that builds tools to empower communities.

The original tool, Ushahidi SMS platform, has grown. Release v3 is a rethinking of the original idea. Simplified code. Simplified interface. Could even function as a headless API. Start to continued simplification and renewed engagement.

## Why v3 and what took you so long?
Explaining the process of how v3 came about. Multiple interfaces. Security. Uncle Bob.

## So you want to deploy Ushahidi? 
Before you install the software, you need to ask some questions...

### What are your needs?
A section expanding on the original opening of the toolkit:

#### What are the objectives of your project?
Would be great to get into a visual framework

#### What data do you need to support your objectives?
#### Who is able to contribute to building those data?
#### How will these audiences contribute to building the data?
#### Why will these audiences contribute?
#### What risks do these audiences face when they contribute?
#### How will you monitor and approve posts and messages?
#### How will you verify the data?
#### How will use the data?
#### How will you inform your contributors about how their data was used?
#### How will you curate the data?

### Which Ushahidi Product meets your needs?

### Citizen Engagement Models
As Ushahidi migrated beyond the basic collection of reports from eyewitnesses to models which collected data in more structured ways, users applied the platform to ever more complex use cases. The collection of evidence for human rights advocacy and litigation has very different requirements than monitoring stock levels of drugs in health facilities. Similarly, the aggregation of social media, SMS, and web reports from a population responding to a crisis or conflict might require de-duplication, translation, geolocation, verification, and collation into reports that capture both individual requests for aid and paint a larger picture of a very dynamic situation. 

Several organizations extended the Ushahidi v2 codebase to meet these needs. In the process, they discovered myriad limitations. In May 2012, a team from Small Surfaces performed a review of these issues. These include

## Ushahidi v3
Ushahidi v3 is not a perfect answer to every design challenge. Rather, it is a flexible platform for the community to build upon.

Report was the standard unit of collection and analysis. But what is a report?
