# Testimony
In Swahili, 'ushahidi' means _testimony_. During the 2008 Kenyan elections... Ushahidi was first designed as a platform to 
enable citizens of Kenya to tell their stories, to give testimony.

The manual would begin with a story: a demonstration of how Ushahidi has been used successfully, but also a story that illustrates the challenge of telling a story with the data. The new capabilities in v3 to tell a story--to give testimony--will form the core the explanation of the manual and toolkit. The manual will begin with the challenges of giving testimony with v2 of the software. We will focus on the new interface and the emphasis on simplicity that the Ushahidi team has adopted in both the code and the UX.
