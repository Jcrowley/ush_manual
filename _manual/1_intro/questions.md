## So you want to deploy Ushahidi? 
Before you install the software, you need to ask some questions...

### What are your needs?
A section expanding on the original opening of the toolkit:

#### What are the objectives of your project?
Would be great to get into a visual framework

#### What data do you need to support your objectives?
#### Who is able to contribute to building those data?
#### How will these audiences contribute to building the data?
#### Why will these audiences contribute?
#### What risks do these audiences face when they contribute?
#### How will you monitor and approve posts and messages?
#### How will you verify the data?
#### How will use the data?
#### How will you inform your contributors about how their data was used?
#### How will you curate the data?
